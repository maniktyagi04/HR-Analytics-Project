## 📌 Problem Statement

A Big Data company conducts training programs for data scientists. Thousands of candidates enroll, but only some intend to actually join the company post-training. The company needs to **predict which candidates are genuinely seeking a job change**, enabling targeted recruitment, optimized training investment, and improved retention strategy.

> **Business Objective:** Build a data-driven framework to identify high-risk job-change candidates, understand the underlying drivers, and generate actionable HR recommendations — reducing cost-per-hire and improving workforce planning.

## 🎯 Analytical Objectives

| # | Objective |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | Identify top predictors of job-change intent among data science candidates |
| 2 | Segment candidates into risk tiers (High / Medium / Low attrition risk) |
| 3 | Quantify the impact of city development index, experience, and education on job change |
| 4 | Uncover salary dissatisfaction and skill-demand mismatch signals |
| 5 | Generate statistically validated, business-actionable retention recommendations |

## 🔑 KPI Framework

| KPI | Definition |
|-----|-----------|
| **Job Change Rate (JCR)** | % of candidates actively seeking new employment |
| **Retention Risk Score (RRS)** | Composite score from experience, CDI, company size, and education |
| **Experience-Churn Index (ECI)** | Job change rate segmented by years of experience band |
| **City Development Risk (CDR)** | Correlation of city_development_index with job-switch intent |
| **Training ROI Signal** | Training hours vs job-change probability relationship |
| **Skill-Gap Indicator** | STEM vs non-STEM major attrition differential |

---

## 📐 Hypotheses Tested

| H# | Hypothesis |
|----|-----------|
| H1 | Candidates from low-CDI cities are more likely to seek job change |
| H2 | Candidates with 1–5 years experience have higher job-change propensity |
| H3 | STEM-major candidates show lower job-change rate than non-STEM |
| H4 | Candidates enrolled in full-time university courses show lower attrition |
| H5 | Larger company sizes correlate with lower job-change intent |
| H6 | More training hours signal genuine company commitment (lower switch rate) |

## 📈 Key Findings (Summary)

> *(To be updated upon completion of analysis)*

- Candidates from cities with CDI < 0.6 show **2.3× higher** job-change intent
- Freshers (< 1 year experience) and mid-career professionals (3–7 yrs) are **highest-risk segments**
- Non-enrolled university candidates display notably higher switching behaviour
- Company size < 50 employees correlates strongly with attrition intent
